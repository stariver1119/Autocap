Desktop Automatic Screen Capture Program with Claude

# Background Story

In early 2022, I stepped away from traditional coding after hearing from industry professionals that AI-driven development would soon render many aspects of manual coding obsolete. However, my interest in automation and system design persisted. Over the past few years, I‚Äôve tackled various repetitive tasks by devising efficient workflows, often leveraging tools like Excel and Word to automate processes. Below are two notable instances where I implemented such solutions:

üìå [1] Automating Military Accounting Tasks

During my military service, I was assigned to the accounting department, responsible for managing funds for the entire unit. Initially, the workload was manageable, but over time, the volume of receipts increased tenfold, and medical expense claims surged due to policy changes during the COVID-19 pandemic.

The existing manual methods‚Äîtranscribing receipt details into Word documents‚Äîbecame unsustainable. Given the constraints of the military environment, installing OCR software or transferring data externally was not feasible. Instead, I analyzed the workflow and discovered a method to transfer data between Excel and Word efficiently. By restructuring the process, I reduced the time required for these tasks by approximately 10 hours, significantly improving operational efficiency.

üìå [2] Streamlining Library Data Collection

Currently, I work at an experimental library that recently needed to catalog 8,000 books. A colleague was manually copying book information into Excel, estimating the task would take a month. Recognizing the inefficiency, I proposed a solution.

I developed a web scraping script to automate the data extraction process. Although I couldn‚Äôt complete it during work hours, I finalized the script over the weekend. By Monday, I provided the complete dataset in Excel format, reducing the projected timeline from one month to just three days.

üîÑ Returning to Coding with AI Assistance

Recently, I encountered a task requiring hourly screen captures of specific data‚Äîa process that disrupted my workflow and concentration. As someone juggling multiple responsibilities, including customer service and administrative duties, this repetitive task was particularly intrusive.

To address this, I collaborated with Claude, an AI coding assistant, to develop a program that automates the screen capture process. This project marked my return to coding, blending traditional programming with AI assistance. Some refer to this approach as ‚Äúvibe coding,‚Äù and while opinions vary, I find it a practical method to solve real-world problems efficiently.

Through this experience, I‚Äôve rekindled my passion for coding and plan to continue developing projects that integrate AI tools to enhance productivity and address everyday challenges.
